To use real camera to detect aruco, it's necessary to install some packages first.
- sudo apt install ros-kinetic-usb_cam
- sudo apt install ros-kinetic-camera-calibration
- sudo apt install ros-kinetic-aruco-detect
- sudo apt install ros-kinetic-fiducials
- sudo apt install ros-kinetic-fiducial-msgs

And, this code is for starting 2 detect node with 1 camera, 
because we want to use 2 different aruco setup.
